# TimeTrackr
An application to help with time management and minimize distractions

## Future Goals
Add a calendar with color codes to track failures/successes throughout the days/weeks/months.<br>
I'm wondering how to implement a focus session on a Windows based system. The function I want to implement will limit certain websites and functionalities by the user and their parameters for a "focus session."

## Dev Notes 04/30/22
For a more basic functionality version, I am going to be developing this application in python 3. <br>
The basic idea is to have a "focus session" last for a specified amount of time inputted by the user. The user will specify the number of minutes they want to set for their focus session. I have the code required to limit certain websites, all I have to do is parse the time variable and get user input. Next steps are to limit certain applications from opening (perhaps this can be achieved with a script?)
